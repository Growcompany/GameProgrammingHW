-------- Complex Demo ---------
*PlayerName*: I was definitely on my way to class, but what kind of world is this?!
*PlayerName*: I have to destroy that portal where zombies are coming out?!
*PlayerName*: I'll protect my base from being destroyed, and then I'll return to my world!!!!
*PlayerName*: Let's go!!!

FunnyGuy: Hey! Did you notice that every option can change in realtime?
FunnyGuy: By the way... Who are you again?
*PlayerName*: I'm *PlayerName*. Wait... Does that mean i can use variables?!
FunnyGuy: Yes you can, *PlayerName*! Easy peasy!
*PlayerName*: Neat! What else can I do?
FunnyGuy: Hum... You can have really long texts, and the RPGTalk itself will break it. Something called Word Warp. You can even have insanaly high amount of words! It's pretty cool!
*PlayerName*: I see! And the text is taken from an external file, isn't that right?
FunnyGuy: Yes it is! It is awesome to work on dialogs later on, or change just one file for different languages. No extra code needed!
FunnyGuy: But, for me, the best part is that we can have Callbacks!
*PlayerName*: Callbacks? Like, when the talk end we call a function in other script?
FunnyGuy: Exactly! Watch me get rid of that wall...
FunnyGuy: ****Magic****
*PlayerName*: Wow! With Callbacks, I can do whatever I want!
FunnyGuy: You can Indeed! Now go talk to my friend on the other room!
*PlayerName*: Ok! Thank you!

*PlayerName*:I wonder if a dialog could follow someone or pass itself... Hum...

*PlayerName*: Hi! I'm *PlayerName*!
Girl: Hi *PlayerName*. I notice that you saw that dialogs can follow objects too. Bacause we use the Unity's Canvas, it can work nice on 3D projects as well.
Girl: It is no problem to have multiple instances of RPGTalk on the same scene either.
Girl: The sounds, names, photos, everything is highly customizable.
*PlayerName*: The code is really simple, too!
Girl: Yes! But listen to me, I'm going to say something so important that the the Talk will be fixed on the screen, even when you can move again.
*PlayerName*: *Listen Carefuly*
